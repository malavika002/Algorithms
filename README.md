# Algorithms
Year 2 module - made to develop 2 projects based on efficient searching algorithms
Project #1 is based on searching for a string in a COVID-19 genome sequence. There are 3 different algorithms for this project. The first one is a simple brute force algorithm, 
following which there are two algorithms which are losely based on slicing

Project #2 is based on an unweighted graph - road-network, minimum cost problem. This used the breadth first search algorithm in order to calculate the path and cost to the 
nearest hospitals to each node.

All algorithms are written in python
